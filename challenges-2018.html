					<h2>Space</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Robots in Space</h3>
						<p>
							Remote control and autonomous robots are crucial to working in hazardous environments like space. The rise of 3D printing, AI, efficient solar power, and high density batteries open a huge range of possibilities for future space faring robots. What might the robots of the future look like? What might we use them for? How will these machines change how we live and work on Earth and in space?
						</p>
						<h3>Back To Earth</h3>
						<p>
							How can space tech be applied back here on Earth? Many super materials and even mundane objects (such as ballpoint pens) owe their existence to the challenges of space exploration. What other current or future space technologies could be applied back on Earth, and what kind of impact might they have?
						</p>
						<h3>Looking Back</h3>
						<p>
							The vast array of satellites we have set to watch the Earth generate a vast wealth of data on our planet. Many of these datasets are made publicly available by the satellite operators, but much of the data is under utilised. Take a look at some open satellite datasets and think about how they could be applied. This could include visualisations, making predictions, aiding decision making, or coordinating other systems.

						<h3>Our City with Futuristic Eyes</h3>
						<em>Provided by School of Architecture Media Hub</em>
						<p>
							Picture of an urban scene that you think can be improved and re-imagine how the scene can be improved by addressing some of the themes below:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Environment (e.g. Pollution, Noise, Resources depletion)</li>
							<li>Identity (e.g. Architectural style, History)</li>
							<li>Community (e.g. Responding to a specific social need)</li>
							<li>Equality (Designing public spaces that work for everyone)</li>

						</ul>
						<h3>Mobility Shift</h3>
						<em>Provided by KnowNow Information</em>
						<p>
							Portsmouth is still a car-dependent city, even though it is flat, dense and in theory, easy to get around. So why do so many inner-city journeys use a car? How can we help to shift citizens out of the car and onto more healthier options such as cycling or walking?
						</p>
						<h3>Mental Health</h3>
						<em>Provided by KnowNow Information</em>
						<p>
							We are increasingly unravelling old misconceptions regarding mental health How though can you use technology and data to improve the mental health outcomes? How can we improve access to mental health counsellors, identify at-risk citizens, and intervene earlier to improve life chances, reducing societal impact?
						</p>
						<h3>Fake News Busting</h3>
						<p>
							False and misleading information is becoming increasingly prevalent online. The volume of text and media produced every day exceeds the capabilities of even the largest organisations to review and moderate. What tools or strategies can we develop to help sift through stories and find the facts?
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section id='game-jam'>
					<h2>Game Jam</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Hands Off</h3>
						<p>
							Create a game controlled primarily with something other than your hands.
						</p>

						<h3>Countdown</h3>
						<p>
							Build a complete experience that can be played in just 60 seconds.
						</p>

						<h3>Indirect Control</h3>
						<p>
							What if a player can't directly control a character, but can only influence their environment?
						</p>

						<h3>Moral Ambiguity</h3>
						<p>
							It's not always clear what is right and what is wrong. Engage players in an experience that can cause them to think about an important belief.
						</p>

					<h2>Smart Cities</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Flooding Prevention</h3>
						<em>Provided by KnowNow Information</em>
						<p>
							Portsmouth is dealing with rising flood waters by building higher seawalls. Meanwhile, climate change is increasing the intensity of rainfall which is putting the sewers under stress.  What kind of system can we use for monitoring water levels across the city? Can we exploit the available LoRaWAN network to act as the backbone for the sensors?
						</p>

						<h3>Biological Solutions</h3>
						<em>Provided by School of Architecture Media Hub</em>
						<p>
							Develop a scheme or object that can be improved by the use of biology. An example of this would be using the notion of a cell, and creating a walled structure that is semi permeable. The permeability can be a metaphor for the movement of people, or a wall within a house which can let a certain amount of light in (Algae grows in sunlight, letting less heat penetrate and shrinks in less sunlight allowing more heat in.).
						</p>

						<h3>Interactive Architecture</h3>
						<em>Provided by School of Architecture Media Hub</em>
						<p>
							Our buildings and homes have already become littered with “intelligent” devices, embedded with smart controllers, sensors, and actuators. Even the most mundane of household appliances have become capable of connecting to the internet and communicating on the smart grid. We must challenge ourselves to go beyond these most basic of integrations and consider how artificial intelligence and robotics can improve the way we plan, build, and inhabit our cities.
						</p>
						<p>
							Choose a space you are familiar with and imagine a way in which the space could be augmented through robotics or interactive technologies. You could then create a series of sketches, drawings, 3D models, or renders of your application, or build a physical model out of cardboard and using an Arduino, make your model move and respond in some way related to your concept.

						<h3>Air Quality</h3>
						<em>Provided by KnowNow Information</em>
						<p>
							The City of Portsmouth has high levels of air pollutants. This affects young children, especially those with asthma. A wearable device that could inform parents and schools of the current air quality would be useful. Could sharing this data with others influence parent behaviour, government policy and influence the use of alternative transport options?
						</p>

						<h3>Night-time Safety</h3>
						<em>Provided by KnowNow Information</em>
						<p>
							A thriving city should have a dynamic night time economy. This depends on the public feeling safe at night. Recent news reports indicate that fear of travelling at night by certain groups is deterring them from venturing out. Can we use technology to deliver a safer city? Would a wearable device that provides location tracking, live real-time life status reporting which provides night-time protection to the individual help?
